# Dropwizard archetype

Dropwizard is great out-of-the-box working implementation of micro-service architecture.

Simple archetype to get you started quickly. Based on [Nick Telford's](https://github.com/nicktelford/dropwizard/tree/feature/dropwizard-archetypes) and [Hakan Dilek's](https://github.com/hakandilek/dropwizard-archetype) work, with some polish added and couple of fixes to make it working with 0.7.1 release of Dropwizard. Scala and Java-Modular Archetypes have been removed.

### Usage

* Clone somewhere into your local machine
* mvn install
* Use dropwizard-create script to save yourself for typing loong command line.
